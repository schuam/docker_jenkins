# Docker Container Running Jenkins

I want to run Jenkins inside a Docker container. The plan is to use the
official Jenkins Docker image and modify it slightly. Additionally I will use
the Docker in Docker container so that Jenkis will be able to use Docker
commands from inside a Docker container. To bring everything up, I plan on
using Docker Compose.
